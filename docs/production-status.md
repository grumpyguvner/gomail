# Production Readiness Status

**Last Updated:** 2025-08-17  
**Current Status:** ⚠️ **NOT PRODUCTION READY**  
**Progress:** Sprint 3 of 4 Complete (75%)

## Overview

GoMail is undergoing a systematic production readiness implementation following a 6-week plan divided into 4 sprints. The system is functional but requires Sprint 4 completion before production deployment.

## Sprint Progress

### ✅ Sprint 1: Critical Security & Testing Foundation
**Status:** Complete (100%)  
**Test Coverage:** 42.1% (Target: 40%)

#### Completed Features:
- Test infrastructure with testify framework
- Unit and integration test suites
- Panic recovery middleware
- Input validation framework
- Structured logging with zap
- Security audit tooling
- Request ID tracking

### ✅ Sprint 2: Core Functionality Hardening
**Status:** Complete (100%)  
**Test Coverage:** 56.4% (Target: 50%)

#### Completed Features:
- Rate limiting middleware (60 req/min default)
- Configuration schema validation
- Graceful shutdown (30s timeout)
- Prometheus metrics integration
- Error categorization system
- Connection pooling and timeouts

### ✅ Sprint 3: SMTP Security & Standards
**Status:** Complete (100%)  
**Test Coverage:** 60%+ achieved

#### Completed Features:
- TLS 1.2+ enforcement with strong ciphers
- STARTTLS support on port 25
- SPF validation (go-msgauth)
- DKIM verification and signing
- DMARC policy enforcement
- Connection limiting per IP
- IP ban management
- Connection throttling

**Note:** Port 587 submission service was removed from scope as GoMail uses API-driven architecture for all email submission.

### ⏳ Sprint 4: Operational Excellence
**Status:** Not Started (0%)  
**Target Dates:** Week 5-6

#### Planned Features:
- [ ] Backup and recovery scripts
- [ ] Prometheus/Grafana monitoring stack
- [ ] Load testing suite (1000 emails/min)
- [ ] Operational runbooks
- [ ] Disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Kubernetes deployment manifests
- [ ] AppArmor security profiles
- [ ] Advanced systemd hardening

## Critical Blockers for Production

1. **No Load Testing**: Performance under load unverified
2. **No Monitoring Stack**: Limited visibility into production issues
3. **No Backup Strategy**: Risk of data loss
4. **No Operational Runbooks**: Unclear incident response
5. **No Kubernetes Support**: Limited deployment options

## Metrics & Quality

### Test Coverage by Package
```
Package                     Coverage   Status
-------------------------------------------- 
internal/api                75.9%      ✅ Good
internal/auth               85%+       ✅ Excellent
internal/config             90.8%      ✅ Excellent
internal/mail               96.8%      ✅ Excellent
internal/metrics            83.6%      ✅ Good
internal/middleware         95.2%      ✅ Excellent
internal/security           88%+       ✅ Good
internal/storage            90.1%      ✅ Excellent
internal/tls                82%+       ✅ Good
internal/validation         92.2%      ✅ Excellent
--------------------------------------------
OVERALL                     60%+       ✅ On Track
```

### Security Posture
- ✅ TLS 1.2+ enforced
- ✅ STARTTLS available
- ✅ SPF/DKIM/DMARC validation
- ✅ Rate limiting active
- ✅ Connection security
- ✅ Bearer token auth
- ✅ Panic recovery
- ⚠️ No penetration testing yet

## Production Readiness Checklist

### ✅ Completed
- [x] Core API functionality
- [x] Postfix integration
- [x] Bearer token authentication
- [x] Structured logging
- [x] Error handling
- [x] Input validation
- [x] Rate limiting
- [x] Metrics collection
- [x] TLS/STARTTLS
- [x] Email authentication (SPF/DKIM/DMARC)
- [x] Connection security
- [x] Configuration validation
- [x] Health endpoints

### ⏳ Remaining (Sprint 4)
- [ ] Load testing validation
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Backup procedures
- [ ] Disaster recovery plan
- [ ] Operational documentation
- [ ] Security audit
- [ ] Kubernetes manifests
- [ ] Performance optimization

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Load Testing**: No verification of 1000 emails/min target
- **Monitoring**: No production observability
- **Recovery**: No tested backup/restore process

### Medium Risk
- **Documentation**: Operational procedures incomplete
- **Deployment**: Limited to systemd environments
- **Security**: No external security audit

### Low Risk
- **Code Quality**: Good test coverage and structure
- **Stability**: Panic recovery and error handling in place
- **Authentication**: Modern protocols implemented

## Go/No-Go Criteria

### ✅ Ready Now
- Development environments
- Testing/staging deployments
- Low-volume production trials
- Proof of concept deployments

### ❌ NOT Ready For
- High-volume production email
- Mission-critical systems
- Compliance-required environments
- Multi-region deployments

## Timeline to Production

Estimated: **2-3 weeks** to complete Sprint 4

### Week 1
- Load testing implementation
- Monitoring stack setup
- Initial performance optimization

### Week 2
- Operational documentation
- Backup/recovery implementation
- Kubernetes deployment

### Week 3
- Security audit
- Final testing
- Go/No-Go decision

## Recommendations

### For Development Use
GoMail is ready for development and testing environments. The core functionality is stable with good test coverage.

### For Production Use
**DO NOT DEPLOY** until Sprint 4 completes. Critical operational features are missing that could lead to:
- Inability to diagnose issues (no monitoring)
- Data loss (no backups)
- Performance problems (untested load)
- Difficult incident response (no runbooks)

### Next Steps
1. Complete Sprint 4 implementation
2. Perform load testing at target capacity
3. Deploy monitoring stack
4. Document operational procedures
5. Conduct security audit
6. Make final Go/No-Go decision
