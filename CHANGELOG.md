## Migration Notes

### From Node.js (0.9.0) to Go (1.0.0)
1. Backup existing configuration and data
2. Stop Node.js mail-api service
3. Install GoMail using quickinstall.sh
4. Configuration is mostly compatible (minor adjustments needed)
5. Data format remains the same (JSON files)

### Breaking Changes
- Binary name changed from `mail-api` to `gomail`
- Service name changed from `mail-api` to `gomail`
- Configuration file moved from `/etc/mail-api/` to `/etc/gomail.yaml`
- Some environment variable names changed (see documentation)
